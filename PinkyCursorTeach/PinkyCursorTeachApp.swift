@main
struct PinkyCursorTeachApp: App {
    
    // Create the brain (ViewModel) for our home screen
    // We create it here so it lives as long as the app is open
    let homeViewModel = HomeViewModel()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            // Show our HomeView instead of ContentView
            HomeView(viewModel: homeViewModel)
        }
    }
}
